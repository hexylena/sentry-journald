# Sentry-Journald

Do you like sentry's data collection, but don't want to run a complicated sentry server? Do you still want to see those cute lil error messages?
Boy howdy do I have the 800 lines of rubbish Golang code for you!

```
$ journalctl -f # optionally -t sentry
Mar 06 13:13:22 w-galaxy sentry[467887]: [event] (proj=web-demo env=production) [http://localhost:4001/test.html:38:5] [http://localhost:4001/test.html:1:1] ReferenceError: someOtherFunction is not defined
Mar 06 13:13:51 w-galaxy sentry[467887]: [event] (proj=py-demo env=development) [sentry-test.py:29:0] NameError: name 'a_potentially_failing_function' is not defined
Mar 06 13:13:51 w-galaxy sentry[467887]: [event] (proj=py-demo env=development) Something went wrong
```

If you want the full data it's stuffed into additional fields in the `journald -o json` format.

```json

## Configuration

There is a `--port` flag (also available as `PORT`) to configure a port from the environment.

Just like real sentry there is no actual authentication of the user, so, it is up to you to add any filtering and anti-spam/abuse you want.

## systemd

A unit file is included for your convenience.

## Comparison

suckless? no this sucks more. (but we don't have torchlit walks, so, tradeoffs ig.)

This is intentionally pretty minimal.

Feature | Actual Sentry | This Rubbish
--- | --- | ---
Receives errors | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ
Receives 'user messages' | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ
Processes sessions/breadcrumbs | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå
Aggregates & deduplicates error messages | ‚úÖ | ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Provides nice breakdowns of user/browser version/etc | ‚úÖ | ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Supports attachments | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå
Has something like spam measures | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå

It's in a similar vein to [hauxir/errorpush](https://github.com/hauxir/errorpush), except instead of shoving it into a DB and asking you to write complicated SQL queries, we shove it into journald and ask you to write complicated jq/awk/sort/uniq/greps to process your data. Which is better? We may never know.
